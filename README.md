# WalNotes

## Promotes the active recall with your own notes.

### Description
WalNotes is an application designed to help users manage and study their notes more effectively. Users can upload handwritten or digital notes and organize them by naming each as a specific topic. The app allows users to add new information to these topics over time. WalNotes then generates quizzes from these topics, with questions derived strictly from the userâ€™s content. These quizzes can include both open-ended and multiple-choice questions.

The app also includes a chat companion that assists users by answering general or specific questions, resolving doubts, and helping to identify specific notes within the topics.

WalNotes utilizes the Gemini API in key functionalities. The API is used for converting images to text, enabling the digitization of handwritten notes. It also plays a role in creating quiz questions through prompt engineering, ensuring that the questions align with the user's content. Additionally, the Gemini API supports the chatbot, enabling it to provide accurate and relevant answers to the user's queries.
